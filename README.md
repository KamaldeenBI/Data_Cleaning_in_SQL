# Project Objective/ Problem Statement
This project aims to achieve only one goal at the end of it. To produce a sparkling clean dataset ready for analysis.
The dataset shows information on the demographics of landed property owners and other material details of properties in Nashville, Tennesse, USA.
A quick glance into the Excel file gives ideas to an extent on what needs to be cleaned:

~ Clustered Column Values (Addresses, City, State)

~ Improper Date formats

~ Improper Data types

~ Significant number of Null values affecting data integrity

~ Standardizing unnecessary Abbreviations affecting consistency of the data.
